# Accessibility

[Accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) provides access for people to technology regardless of their ability.  [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.section508.gov/) that requires federal agencies to provide software and website accessibility to people with disabilities.   Interfaces (websites, mobile apps, and interactive tools) that we design should be accessible. 



The Office of Public Outreach has put together a [collection of resources about accessibility](https://innerspace.stsci.edu/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=OPO&title=Accessibility).  
It is highly recommended to review the resources there for how to make your software more accessible. 


## Websites

Websites designed at the institute should be compliant with [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) guidelines for web accessibility.   


## Universal Color Design 

Plots and graphs should use color maps that are accessible.   The [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html#color-vision-deficiencies) recommendation is to avoid colors maps that include both red and green. 

Here are some more additional resources for color design:
* [vischeck](http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/) is a tool for checking color maps for different types of color vision deficiencies

* ["How to make figures and presentations that are friendly to Colorblind people"](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/) -  a Japanese website, but great info and visuals for this topic  
* [Scientific American: End of the Rainbow? New Map Scale Is More Readable by People Who Are Color Blind](https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/B6E80020-7BE2-4571-B219D36BF2ECB6D7_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335)
